# Welcome to MiniFy

MiniFy is a lightweight Spotify mini player built with Tauri and React. It lives as a frameless desktop overlay, polls the Spotify API for your currently playing track, and gives you instant playback controls, themeable layouts, and native OS menus—all without leaving your workflow.

## What makes MiniFy special

MiniFy combines the convenience of a mini player with powerful features you won't find elsewhere:

### Always accessible

MiniFy floats above your other windows, giving you instant access to playback controls without switching apps. The frameless design and compact layouts (horizontal, vertical card, and minimal views) ensure it never gets in your way.

### AI-powered music discovery

Connect your preferred AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, or Groq) and get intelligent music recommendations through natural conversation. Ask for "something energetic" or "songs like my recent listens" and let the AI DJ analyze your taste.

```typescript
// AI DJ uses Spotify's audio features for smart recommendations
const audioFeatures = await spotify.getAudioFeatures(trackId);
// Returns: energy, mood, tempo, danceability, acousticness, and more
```

### Secure by design

All credentials are stored in your operating system's secure credential manager—never in plain text files:

| Platform | Storage |
|----------|----------|
| Windows  | Credential Manager |
| macOS    | Keychain |
| Linux    | Secret Service |

<Note>
  MiniFy uses OAuth PKCE flow for Spotify authentication and stores all API keys (Spotify tokens, AI provider keys) in OS-level secure storage via the Rust `keyring` crate.
</Note>

### Theme Studio

Create your own themes with the built-in JSON editor. Full control over:

- Panel background, border radius, and shadows
- Control icon colors and hover states
- Playback bar styling (track background, fill gradient, thumb)
- Typography (song title, artist colors and weights)
- Action button styling
- Album cover borders and radius

```json
{
  "name": "my-custom-theme",
  "panel": {
    "background": "rgba(18, 18, 18, 0.85)",
    "borderRadius": 18,
    "shadow": "0 14px 36px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.65)"
  },
  "controls": {
    "iconColor": "#E5E5E5",
    "iconColorActive": "#FFFFFF"
  }
}
```

Export and share your themes as JSON files.

## AI DJ features

The AI DJ analyzes your listening history and provides intelligent recommendations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your AI provider">
    Add your API key for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, or Groq in Settings → AI DJ.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start a conversation">
    Open the AI DJ chat and describe what you want to listen to in natural language.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get smart recommendations">
    The AI analyzes your last 30 tracks, top artists, and Spotify's audio features (energy, mood, tempo, danceability) to suggest perfect matches.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auto-queue mode">
    Enable AI Queue to automatically generate endless playlists. When 2 tracks remain, the next batch is fetched automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  AI Queue uses your configured AI provider's API and will consume tokens. A red border appears when active as a visual reminder. Configure this in Settings → AI DJ.
</Warning>

### Supported AI providers

- **OpenAI** — GPT-4o Mini
- **Anthropic** — Claude 3 Haiku  
- **Google AI** — Gemini 1.5 Flash

## Tech stack

MiniFy is built with modern, performant technologies:

- **Desktop**: Tauri 2, React 19, Vite 7, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Backend**: Rust with Tauri commands for OAuth, secure keyring storage, and Spotify API calls
- **AI**: Vercel AI SDK with tool calling for Spotify integration
- **API**: Spotify Web API with OAuth PKCE flow

## Architecture

    C --> E[Spotify API]
    A --> F[Vercel AI SDK]
    F --> G[AI Providers]

```

All credentials (Spotify tokens, AI API keys) are stored in your OS-level secure keyring. The React UI communicates with Rust backend commands via Tauri's IPC bridge. AI DJ uses the Vercel AI SDK with tool-calling to integrate with Spotify playback.
