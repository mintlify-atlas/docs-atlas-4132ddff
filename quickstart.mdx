# Quick start

This guide will take you from installation to playing your first track in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- MiniFy installed on your system ([installation guide](/installation))
- A Spotify account (Free or Premium)
- A Spotify Developer Client ID ([setup instructions](/installation#spotify-developer-setup))

## First launch

When you launch MiniFy for the first time, you'll go through a guided setup process.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your music provider">
    MiniFy supports multiple music providers. For this guide, select **Spotify**.
    
    <Note>
      YouTube Music and Apple Music support are in development. Currently, Spotify is the primary supported provider.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter your Spotify Client ID">
    Paste the Client ID you created in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
    
    ```typescript
    // MiniFy stores this securely in your OS keyring
    await invoke("save_spotify_client_id", { clientId: "your-client-id" });
    ```
    
    Click **Continue** to proceed to authentication.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authorize with Spotify">
    MiniFy will open your browser to complete OAuth authentication. You'll be asked to:
    
    1. Log in to your Spotify account (if not already logged in)
    2. Review the permissions MiniFy requests:
       - Read your currently playing track
       - Control playback (play, pause, skip, volume)
       - Access your playlists and saved tracks
       - Read your top artists and recent listening history
    3. Click **Agree** to authorize
    
    Your browser will show a success message and automatically redirect back to MiniFy.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Success">
    Once authorized, MiniFy will display your currently playing track (if any) or show "No track playing" if Spotify is idle.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Playing your first track

Now that you're connected, let's play some music.

### Start playback from Spotify

The easiest way to get started:

1. Open the Spotify desktop app or web player
2. Start playing any track
3. MiniFy will automatically detect and display it within 2 seconds

### Control playback from MiniFy

Once a track is playing, you can control it directly from MiniFy:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Play/Pause" icon="play">
    Click the play/pause button in the center of the player
  </Card>
  <Card title="Skip tracks" icon="forward">
    Use the next/previous buttons to navigate your queue
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scrub timeline" icon="sliders">
    Click or drag the playback bar to jump to any position
  </Card>
  <Card title="Save to library" icon="heart">
    Click the heart icon to add the current track to your Liked Songs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Playback controls reference

```typescript
// MiniFy's playback controls are implemented via Spotify Web API

// Play/Pause
await spotify.play();  // or spotify.pause()

// Skip tracks
await spotify.skipToNext();
await spotify.skipToPrevious();

// Seek to position (in milliseconds)
await spotify.seek(120000);  // Jump to 2:00

// Save to library
await spotify.addToMySavedTracks([trackId]);
```

## Customizing your player

MiniFy is highly customizable. Let's explore the key settings.

### Access settings

Right-click anywhere on the MiniFy window and select **Settings** from the context menu.

Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut (if configured).

### Choose a layout

MiniFy offers three distinct layouts:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Layout A">
    **Horizontal compact view**
    
    Perfect for placing at the top or bottom of your screen. Shows album art, track info, and controls in a single row.
    
    - Best for: Ultrawide monitors, top/bottom screen placement
    - Dimensions: ~600px wide × 100px tall
    - Elements: Album art (left), track info (center), controls (right)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Layout B">

    - Best for: Corner placement, larger album art display
    - Dimensions: ~300px wide × 400px tall
    - Elements: Large album art (top), track info and controls (stacked below)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Layout C">

    Just the essentials—smallest footprint possible.
    
    - Best for: Maximum screen real estate, minimalists

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using the AI DJ

MiniFy's AI DJ feature provides intelligent music recommendations based on your listening history.

### Connect an AI provider

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get an API key">
    Choose your preferred AI provider and obtain an API key:
    
    - **OpenAI**: [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (uses GPT-4o Mini)
    - **Anthropic**: [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) (uses Claude 3 Haiku)
    - **Google AI**: [aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) (uses Gemini 1.5 Flash)
    - **Groq**: [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys) (uses Llama 3.1 8B)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add your API key to MiniFy">
    1. Open Settings → Connections
    2. Scroll to "AI Provider" section
    3. Find your chosen provider and click the input field
    4. Paste your API key and click **Connect**
    
    MiniFy will validate the key and store it securely in your OS keyring.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set as active provider">
    If you have multiple AI providers configured, click **Set Active** on your preferred one.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Ask the AI DJ for recommendations

Once connected, open the AI DJ chat from the context menu:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open AI DJ">
    Right-click on MiniFy → AI DJ
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start a conversation">
    Try these example prompts:
    
    - "Play something energetic and upbeat"
    - "Find songs similar to my recent listens"
    - "I'm in the mood for chill electronic music"
    - "Recommend tracks based on my top artists"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get recommendations">
    The AI analyzes:
    - Your last 30 played tracks
    - Your top artists and genres
    - Spotify's audio features (energy, mood, tempo, danceability, acousticness)
    
    And returns 5 personalized recommendations with explanations.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Play recommendations">
    Click any recommended track to start playing immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Enable AI auto-queue

For endless AI-generated playlists:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open AI DJ chat">
    Right-click on MiniFy → AI DJ
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable auto-queue">
    Toggle the "AI Queue" switch in the chat interface.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Let it play">
    The AI will:
    1. Generate 5 tracks based on your listening history
    2. Queue and play them automatically
    3. When 2 tracks remain, fetch the next batch
    4. Cache your preferences for 10 minutes to minimize API calls
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  AI Queue consumes API tokens. A red border appears around MiniFy when active as a reminder. Disable it when not needed to conserve tokens.
  
  You can hide the red border in Settings → AI DJ → "Show Token Warning Border" (though we recommend keeping it visible).
</Warning>

### AI DJ technical details

MiniFy uses the Vercel AI SDK with tool-calling to integrate with Spotify:

```typescript
// AI DJ tools available to the LLM
const tools = {
  get_current_track: async () => {
    return await spotify.getMyCurrentPlayingTrack();
  },
  
  get_recently_played: async ({ limit }) => {
    return await spotify.getMyRecentlyPlayedTracks({ limit });
  },
  
  get_top_artists: async ({ time_range, limit }) => {
    return await spotify.getMyTopArtists({ time_range, limit });
  },
  
  search_tracks: async ({ query, limit }) => {
    return await spotify.searchTracks(query, { limit });
  },
  
  get_audio_features: async ({ track_ids }) => {
    return await spotify.getAudioFeaturesForTracks(track_ids);
  },
  
  play_track: async ({ track_uri }) => {
    return await spotify.play({ uris: [track_uri] });
  }
};
```

The AI has access to these tools and can call them to understand your taste and control playback.

## Keyboard shortcuts

While MiniFy doesn't currently have configurable keyboard shortcuts, you can control playback using Spotify's global media keys:

- **Next Track** — Media Next key
- **Previous Track** — Media Previous key

<Note>
  Custom keyboard shortcut configuration is planned for a future release. Follow the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/ModioStudio/projects/2) for updates.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Track not displaying

1. Verify you have an active Spotify session (open the Spotify app and play something)
2. Check that MiniFy is authorized (Settings → Connections → Spotify should show "Connected")
3. Ensure your Spotify Client ID redirect URI is set to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback`

### OAuth keeps failing

1. Double-check your Spotify Client ID in Settings → Connections
2. Verify port 3000 is not blocked by your firewall
3. Clear credentials and re-authenticate:
   ```typescript
   // MiniFy includes a clear credentials command
   await invoke("clear_credentials");
   ```

### AI DJ not responding

1. Verify your API key is valid (Settings → Connections → AI Provider)
2. Check your internet connection
3. Ensure you have an active AI provider set (look for "Active" status)
4. Check the browser console (F12) for error messages

### MiniFy window disappeared

MiniFy stays always-on-top by default, but can sometimes hide behind other windows:

1. Check your taskbar/dock for the MiniFy icon
2. Alt+Tab (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Tab (macOS) to cycle through windows
3. If all else fails, restart MiniFy from your application menu
