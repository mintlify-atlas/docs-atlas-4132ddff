# Privacy Policy

MiniFy is designed with privacy as a core principle. This document explains what data is collected, where it's stored, and how it's used.

## Privacy Principles

<Info>
**MiniFy is a local-first application.** All your data stays on your device. We don't operate servers that collect, store, or analyze your data.
</Info>

### What MiniFy Does NOT Do

- ❌ **No data collection servers** - MiniFy doesn't send your data to our servers
- ❌ **No analytics or tracking** - We don't track how you use the app
- ❌ **No telemetry** - No usage statistics are collected
- ❌ **No third-party tracking** - No advertising or analytics SDKs
- ❌ **No credential proxying** - Your Spotify tokens never pass through our servers

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

All MiniFy data is stored locally on your device:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Credentials (Keyring)">
    **Storage:** OS-level secure keyring
    
    **What's stored:**
    - Spotify access tokens (expires after 1 hour)
    - Spotify refresh tokens (doesn't expire)
    - Token expiration timestamps
    - Spotify Client ID (if custom)
    - AI provider API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq)
    - Selected music provider
    
    **Implementation:**
    ```rust
    // spotify_auth.rs:16
    const KEYRING_SERVICE: &str = "minify";
    
    // All credentials stored under "minify" service
    fn entry(key: &str) -> Result<Entry, keyring::Error> {
        Entry::new(KEYRING_SERVICE, key)
    }
    ```
    
    **Security:** Encrypted by your OS, protected by your user account password
    
    See [Credential Storage](/security/credential-storage) for details.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Application Data">
    **Storage:** Standard OS application data directories
    
    **Typical locations:**
    - **Windows:** `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\minify\`
    - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/minify/`
    - **Linux:** `~/.config/minify/` or `~/.local/share/minify/`
    
    **What's stored:**
    - App settings and preferences
    - Window size and position
    - UI state (last viewed tab, etc.)
    - Theme preferences
    - Local cache of recently played tracks
    
    **Security:** Protected by OS file permissions (user-readable only)
    
    <Note>
    No credentials are stored in application data directories - only in the secure keyring.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="In-Memory Cache">
    **Storage:** Process memory (RAM)
    
    **What's cached:**
    ```rust
    // spotify_auth.rs:23-27
    lazy_static::lazy_static! {
        static ref CLIENT_ID_CACHE: Arc<Mutex<Option<String>>>;
        static ref TOKENS_CACHE: Arc<Mutex<Option<SpotifyTokens>>>;
        static ref MUSIC_PROVIDER_CACHE: Arc<Mutex<Option<String>>>;
    }
    
    // ai_keyring.rs:9-11
    lazy_static::lazy_static! {
        static ref AI_KEY_CACHE: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, String>>>;
    }
    ```
    
    **Purpose:** Reduce keyring access frequency for better performance
    
    **Lifetime:** Cleared when app closes or credentials are cleared
    
    **Security:** Process memory is protected by OS memory isolation
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Data Sharing

### Direct Connections Only

MiniFy communicates directly with service providers - your data never goes through our servers:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Spotify API">
    **Direct connection to:** `api.spotify.com`
    
    **What's sent:**
    - OAuth access token (in Authorization header)
    - API requests (play, pause, skip, search, etc.)
    
    **Implementation:**
    ```rust
    // spotify_auth.rs:243-258
    pub async fn verify_spotify_access(access_token: &str) -> Result<(), String> {
        let client = reqwest::Client::new();
        let response = client
            .get("https://api.spotify.com/v1/me")
            .bearer_auth(access_token)  // Direct to Spotify
            .send()
            .await?;
    }
    ```
    
    **Privacy:** Subject to [Spotify's Privacy Policy](https://www.spotify.com/privacy)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Spotify OAuth">
    **Direct connection to:** `accounts.spotify.com`
    
    **What's sent:**
    - Authorization code (during OAuth flow)
    - Code verifier (PKCE proof)
    - Client ID
    - Refresh token (when refreshing access)
    
    **Implementation:**
    ```rust
    // spotify_auth.rs:336-343
    let response = client
        .post("https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token")  // Direct to Spotify
        .header(CONTENT_TYPE, "application/x-www-form-urlencoded")
        .form(&form)
        .send()
        .await?;
    ```
    
    **Privacy:** OAuth tokens are obtained directly from Spotify, never proxied
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="AI Providers">
    **Direct connections to:**
    - OpenAI: `api.openai.com`
    - Anthropic: `api.anthropic.com`
    - Google: `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`
    - Groq: `api.groq.com`
    
    **What's sent:**
    - Your API key (in Authorization header)
    - Playlist generation prompts
    - AI feature requests
    
    **Privacy:** Subject to each provider's privacy policy
    
    <Info>
    AI features are opt-in. MiniFy doesn't communicate with AI providers unless you explicitly use AI features.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Network Traffic

### Local OAuth Server

During authentication, MiniFy starts a local server:

```rust
// spotify_auth.rs:451-452
let addr: SocketAddr = "127.0.0.1:3000".parse().unwrap();
let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind(addr).await?;
```

**Purpose:** Receive OAuth callback from Spotify

**Exposure:** Only accessible from localhost (127.0.0.1)

**Lifetime:** Automatically shut down after successful auth or 5-minute timeout

**Security:** Cannot be accessed from outside your device

### No External Connections

MiniFy makes no network connections except:

1. **Spotify API/OAuth** (required for music control)
2. **AI provider APIs** (only when you use AI features)

<Warning>
If you see unexpected network activity from MiniFy, please report it as a security issue.
</Warning>

    #[tauri::command]
    pub async fn delete_ai_api_key(provider: String) -> Result<(), String>
    
    // ai_keyring.rs:146-163
    #[tauri::command]
    pub async fn clear_all_ai_keys() -> Result<(), String>
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data Retention

### Automatic Expiration

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Access Tokens">
    **Expires:** After 1 hour
    
    **Auto-refresh:** Yes, using refresh token
    
    ```rust
    // spotify_auth.rs:643-656
    pub fn spawn_token_refresh_task(app: AppHandle) {
        rt::spawn(async move {
            loop {
                sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(300)).await;
                if let Ok(tokens) = get_tokens().await {
                    let now = Utc::now().timestamp();
                    if now + 300 >= tokens.expires_at {
                        let _ = refresh_access_token().await;  // Auto-refresh
                    }
                }
            }
        });
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Refresh Tokens">
    **Expires:** Never (until you revoke access)
    
    **Revoke access:**
    1. Visit [Spotify Account Apps](https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/)
    2. Find "MiniFy" (or your custom app name)
    3. Click **Remove Access**
    
    After revoking, MiniFy can no longer access your Spotify account.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="In-Memory Cache">
    **Cleared when:**
    - App closes/restarts
    - Credentials are cleared via settings
    - Manual sign-out
    
    ```rust
    // spotify_auth.rs:39-43
    fn clear_cached_tokens() {
        if let Ok(mut cache) = TOKENS_CACHE.lock() {
            *cache = None;
        }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Manual Deletion

You can delete all MiniFy data at any time:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clear Credentials">
    **Via MiniFy UI:** Settings → Clear Credentials
    
    **Effect:**
    - Removes all tokens from keyring
    - Clears in-memory caches
    - Stops OAuth server if running
    - Signs you out of MiniFy
    
    **Implementation:** See [Credential Storage](/security/credential-storage#deleting-credentials) (`spotify_auth.rs:300-324`)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Uninstall MiniFy">
    **Effect:**
    - Removes application files
    - May not remove keyring credentials (OS-dependent)
    
    **Recommendation:** Clear credentials before uninstalling
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Manual Keyring Cleanup">
    See [Manual Credential Management](/security/credential-storage#manual-credential-management) for OS-specific instructions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Third-Party Services

MiniFy connects to third-party services that have their own privacy policies:

| Service | Purpose | Privacy Policy |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Spotify** | Music streaming and control | [spotify.com/privacy](https://www.spotify.com/privacy) |
| **OpenAI** | AI playlist generation (optional) | [openai.com/privacy](https://openai.com/privacy) |
| **Anthropic** | AI playlist generation (optional) | [anthropic.com/privacy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy) |
| **Google AI** | AI playlist generation (optional) | [google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) |
| **Groq** | AI playlist generation (optional) | [groq.com/privacy](https://groq.com/privacy-policy/) |

<Note>
MiniFy is not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party services. Review their policies independently.
</Note>

## Your Rights

### Data Access

All your MiniFy data is stored locally. You have complete access:

- **Credentials:** View via OS keyring tools (see [Credential Storage](/security/credential-storage))
- **Settings:** Located in standard app data directories
- **Source code:** MiniFy is open source - audit the code yourself

### Data Portability

Your data never leaves your device (except direct API calls), so there's no data to export from MiniFy servers. Your Spotify data is exportable via [Spotify's Data Download](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/).

### Data Deletion

You have complete control to delete MiniFy data:

1. **In-app:** Settings → Clear Credentials
2. **OS keyring:** Manual deletion (see [Manual Credential Management](/security/credential-storage#manual-credential-management))
3. **App data:** Delete app data directories
4. **Spotify data:** Revoke access at [spotify.com/account/apps](https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/)

## Security Practices

### What MiniFy Does

✅ **Uses OS secure keyring** for all credentials

✅ **Implements OAuth PKCE** for secure authentication

✅ **Direct API connections** (no proxy servers)

✅ **Automatic token refresh** (reduces exposure time)

✅ **Local-only server** for OAuth callbacks (127.0.0.1)

✅ **State nonce validation** (CSRF protection)

### What You Should Do

<Warning>
**Protect your OS account:**
- Use a strong password for your computer
- Enable full-disk encryption (BitLocker/FileVault/LUKS)
- Lock your screen when away
- Keep your OS updated

Keyring security depends on your OS account security.
</Warning>

## Open Source Transparency

MiniFy is open source. You can:

- **Audit the code** to verify privacy claims
- **Build from source** to ensure no hidden tracking
- **Contribute** to improve security and privacy
- **Report issues** if you find privacy concerns

## Updates to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated as MiniFy adds features. Check the documentation for the latest version.

**Last updated:** [Document creation date]
