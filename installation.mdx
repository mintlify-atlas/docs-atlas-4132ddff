  <Tab title="Windows">
    ### Windows installation

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Download the installer">
        Download `MiniFy_x.x.x_x64_en-US.msi` from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/ModioStudio/MiniFy/releases/latest).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Run the installer">
        Double-click the `.msi` file and follow the installation wizard.
        
        You may see a Windows SmartScreen warning on first run. Click "More info" and then "Run anyway" to proceed.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Launch MiniFy">
        MiniFy will be added to your Start Menu. Launch it from there or use the desktop shortcut if created.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Installing WebView2

    MiniFy requires Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime. Windows 11 includes this by default. If you're on Windows 10 and MiniFy fails to start:

    1. Download the [WebView2 Runtime installer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section)
    2. Run the installer and restart MiniFy

    ### Portable version

    Alternatively, download `MiniFy_x.x.x_x64.exe` for a portable version that doesn't require installation. Simply run the executable from any folder.

    <Warning>
      The portable version stores credentials in the Windows Credential Manager under your user account. Moving the executable to a different machine will require re-authentication.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="macOS">
    ### macOS installation

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Download the DMG">
        Download `MiniFy_x.x.x_aarch64.dmg` (Apple Silicon) or `MiniFy_x.x.x_x64.dmg` (Intel) from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/ModioStudio/MiniFy/releases/latest).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Open the DMG">
        Double-click the `.dmg` file to mount it.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Install the app">
        Drag the MiniFy app icon to your Applications folder.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Launch MiniFy">
        Open MiniFy from your Applications folder or Spotlight.
        
        On first launch, you may see a security warning because the app isn't signed with an Apple Developer certificate.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Bypassing Gatekeeper

    If macOS blocks MiniFy from opening:

    1. Right-click (or Control+click) the MiniFy app in Applications
    2. Select "Open" from the context menu
    3. Click "Open" in the security dialog

    Alternatively, grant permission via System Settings:

    ```bash
    # Open System Settings → Privacy & Security
    # Scroll to "Security" section
    # Click "Open Anyway" next to the MiniFy blocked message
    ```

    <Note>
      MiniFy credentials are stored in macOS Keychain under the service name `minify`. You can view these entries in Keychain Access.app.
    </Note>

  <Tab title="Linux">
    ### Linux installation

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Download the package">
        Download the appropriate package for your distribution from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/ModioStudio/MiniFy/releases/latest):
        
        - **Debian/Ubuntu**: `MiniFy_x.x.x_amd64.deb`
        - **Fedora/RHEL**: `MiniFy_x.x.x.x86_64.rpm`
        - **Arch**: `MiniFy_x.x.x.x86_64.AppImage`
        - **Universal**: `MiniFy_x.x.x.x86_64.AppImage`
      </Step>
      <Step title="Install dependencies">
        Ensure you have the required dependencies:
        
        **Debian/Ubuntu:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0 libgtk-3-0 gnome-keyring
        ```
        
        **Fedora:**
        ```bash
        sudo dnf install webkit2gtk4.1 gtk3 gnome-keyring
        ```
        
        **Arch:**
        ```bash
        sudo pacman -S webkit2gtk gtk3 gnome-keyring
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Install the package">
        **Debian/Ubuntu:**
        ```bash
        sudo dpkg -i MiniFy_x.x.x_amd64.deb
        sudo apt install -f  # Fix any missing dependencies
        ```
        
        **Fedora:**
        ```bash
        sudo rpm -i MiniFy_x.x.x.x86_64.rpm
        ```
        
        **AppImage (all distros):**
        ```bash
        chmod +x MiniFy_x.x.x.x86_64.AppImage
        ./MiniFy_x.x.x.x86_64.AppImage
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Launch MiniFy">
        Run from your application menu or terminal:
        ```bash
        minify
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Secret service setup

    MiniFy requires a running secret service daemon to store credentials securely. Most desktop environments include this by default.

    **GNOME/Ubuntu:**
    ```bash
    # gnome-keyring should be running by default
    # Verify with:
    ps aux | grep gnome-keyring
    ```

    **KDE Plasma:**
    ```bash
    # KWallet is the default
    # Verify with:
    ps aux | grep kwalletd
    ```

    **Other desktop environments:**
    ```bash
    # Install and enable gnome-keyring
    sudo apt install gnome-keyring  # Debian/Ubuntu
    
    # Add to your session startup:
    gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=secrets
    ```

    <Warning>
      Without a secret service daemon, MiniFy cannot store credentials and will fail during authentication. Ensure gnome-keyring or an equivalent is running.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Spotify developer setup

MiniFy requires a Spotify Developer Client ID to authenticate with the Spotify API. This is free and takes 2 minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Spotify app">
    Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and log in with your Spotify account.
    
    Click "Create app" and fill in:
    - **App name**: MiniFy (or any name you prefer)
    - **App description**: Personal Spotify mini player
    - **Redirect URI**: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback`
    - **API**: Check "Web API"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your Client ID">
    After creating the app, you'll see your **Client ID** on the app dashboard. Copy this value.
    
    You do NOT need the Client Secret for MiniFy (we use OAuth PKCE flow).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Client ID in MiniFy">
    When you first launch MiniFy, you'll be prompted to enter your Spotify Client ID. Paste the value from step 2.
    
    MiniFy will store this securely in your OS keyring.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Your Spotify Client ID is stored locally on your machine. MiniFy is open source and makes no external requests except to Spotify's official API.
</Note>

## Verification

After installation, verify MiniFy is working correctly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch the app">
    Open MiniFy from your application menu or desktop shortcut.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check window appearance">
    You should see a frameless, transparent window with MiniFy's boot screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify credentials storage">
    MiniFy will prompt for provider selection and Spotify setup on first launch. This confirms credential storage is working.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### MiniFy won't start

**Windows:**
- Install [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section)
- Check Windows Event Viewer for error messages

**macOS:**
- Grant permission via System Settings → Privacy & Security
- Check Console.app for crash logs

**Linux:**
- Verify webkit2gtk is installed: `dpkg -l | grep webkit2gtk`
- Ensure secret service is running: `ps aux | grep keyring`
- Check logs: `journalctl -xe | grep minify`

### OAuth fails during authentication

1. Verify your Spotify Client ID is correct
2. Check that redirect URI is set to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback` in your Spotify app settings
3. Ensure port 3000 is not blocked by firewall
4. Try clearing credentials:
   ```bash
   # From the MiniFy source directory:
   pnpm desktop:clear
   ```

### Credentials not saving

**Windows:**
- Open Credential Manager and verify "minify" entries exist
- Run as administrator if permission issues persist

**macOS:**
- Open Keychain Access.app and search for "minify"
- Grant keychain access when prompted

**Linux:**
- Ensure secret service is running: `systemctl --user status gnome-keyring`
- Test keyring access: `secret-tool store --label='test' application 'test'`

## Next steps
